# üìß Email Confirmation Troubleshooting Guide

## üö® **Not Receiving Confirmation Emails?**

This is a common issue in development with Supabase's default email provider. Here are the solutions:

---

## üîç **Step 1: Check Your Email Thoroughly**

### Check These Locations:
- ‚úÖ **Inbox** - Primary folder
- ‚úÖ **Spam/Junk** - Most common location for Supabase emails
- ‚úÖ **Promotions** - Gmail's promotions tab
- ‚úÖ **Updates** - Gmail's updates tab
- ‚úÖ **All Mail** - Search for "supabase" or "confirmation"

### Search Terms to Try:
- "supabase"
- "confirmation"
- "verify"
- "brkzsfbiuazrbmpnpzyl" (your project ID)

---

## üîÑ **Step 2: Use the Resend Feature**

Your app has a built-in resend feature:

1. **On the confirmation error page**, click "Get New Confirmation Email"
2. **Enter your email address** that you used to register
3. **Check all email folders** again (including spam)
4. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for email delivery

## üõ†Ô∏è **Step 3: Development Workarounds**

### Option A: Try Different Email Provider
- Use a different email service (Yahoo, Outlook, ProtonMail)
- Avoid Gmail if it's filtering the emails

### Option B: Check Supabase Dashboard
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/brkzsfbiuazrbmpnpzyl
2. Navigate to **Authentication > Users**
3. Find your user account
4. Check if there's a way to manually confirm

### Option C: Use Development Bypass
If you're in development mode, the app now includes a development bypass component that appears on the email confirmation error page.

## ‚ö° **Quick Fix for Development**
